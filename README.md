## Getting Started
### Installation
To use the Alchemy SDK in your Go project, you need to install it using go get:

Copy code
```bash
go get -u github.com/nabetse00/alchemy-sdk-go
```
### Usage
To start using the Alchemy SDK in your Go application, follow these steps:

- Import the Alchemy SDK package:

```go
import "github.com/nabetse00/alchemy-sdk-go"
```
Set up your API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the Alchemy platform.


```go
var client = &AlchemyClient{}
err := client.Init(apiKey, network, maxRetry, delay, baseUrlApiV2)
```
Use the SDK to interact with the Alchemy API. For example, to fetch blockchain data:

```go
var client = &AlchemyClient{}

// Query blockchain data
response, err := client.eth_XXX(params)

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Process the response
fmt.Println(response)
```
